# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this homelab infrastructure repository!

## 🔒 Security First

**NEVER commit secrets, passwords, tokens, or any sensitive information.**

Before contributing, ensure:
- Pre-commit hooks are installed: `pre-commit install`
- All sensitive data uses `.env` files or Ansible Vault
- Example files use `CHANGE_ME` placeholders
- `docs/SECURITY_RULEBOOK.md` is followed for incident handling and pre-push security workflow

## 🎨 Code Style

### Docker Compose Files
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  service-name:
    image: service:latest
    container_name: service-name
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ:-UTC}
      - SERVICE_SECRET=${SERVICE_SECRET}
    volumes:
      - service_data:/data
    networks:
      - proxy
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  service_data:

networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

### Environment Files
```bash
# Service Name Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# Generate secrets with: ../../scripts/generate-secrets.sh

# Primary secret
SERVICE_SECRET=CHANGE_ME_GENERATE_WITH_openssl_rand

# Configuration
DOMAIN=smartmur.lab
TZ=UTC
```

### README Files

Each service should have:
```markdown
# Service Name

Brief description

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env  # Update secrets
```

### 2. Deploy
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🧪 Testing

Before submitting:

```bash
# Validate secrets
./scripts/validate-secrets.sh

# Security checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Test compose file
cd YourService
docker-compose config

# Start service
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Test functionality
# (Access web UI, test features, etc.)

# Clean up
docker-compose down -v
```

## 📚 Documentation

Good documentation includes:
- Clear setup instructions
- Environment variable descriptions
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting section
- Links to official documentation

## ❌ What NOT to Do

- ❌ Commit `.env` files
- ❌ Commit passwords or tokens
- ❌ Commit API keys
- ❌ Use hardcoded secrets
- ❌ Commit without testing
- ❌ Skip pre-commit hooks
- ❌ Skip `docs/SECURITY_RULEBOOK.md` incident workflow after a leak
- ❌ Use absolute paths (use relative or env vars)
- ❌ Commit large binary files

## ✅ Best Practices

- ✅ Use environment variables for configuration
- ✅ Provide `.example` files for sensitive configs
- ✅ Include health checks in compose files
- ✅ Use named volumes
- ✅ Set proper file permissions
- ✅ Include security_opt: no-new-privileges
- ✅ Use specific image tags (not `latest` in production)
- ✅ Document all requirements

   - Docker version: `docker --version`
   - Compose version: `docker-compose --version`
   - OS/Distribution
   - Error messages (sanitize any secrets!)
